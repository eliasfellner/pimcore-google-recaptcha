# When should I use this bundle?
Whenever an action in your **Pimcore**-project needs to be protected with [Google reCAPTCHA V3](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html).

# Why should I use this bundle?
If your site has some kind of authentication (e.g., login, registration, ...) or allows to submit product reviews, you'll
want to include [Google reCAPTCHA](https://www.google.com/recaptcha/intro/v3.html) into your site as this will increase both _trustworthiness_ and _security_.
